<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrective Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Divergent Lens</li><li>Convergent Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The corrective lenses market consists primarily of divergent and convergent lenses, each serving specific visual needs. Divergent lenses, known as concave lenses, are used to correct nearsightedness (myopia) by spreading light rays outward, allowing clearer vision for distant objects. Conversely, convergent lenses, or convex lenses, correct farsightedness (hyperopia) by focusing light rays inward, enhancing clarity for nearby objects. Both types are essential for addressing various refractive errors, driving demand in the eyewear and optical industries.</p></p>
