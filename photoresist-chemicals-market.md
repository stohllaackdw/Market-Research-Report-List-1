<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist chemicals market is primarily divided into two types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble when exposed to light, allowing the developer to remove the exposed areas, which is ideal for intricate circuit patterns. In contrast, negative photoresist hardens upon exposure, making the unexposed areas removable. Each type is crucial in the semiconductor and electronics industries for photolithography processes, impacting the fabrication of integrated circuits and other microelectronic devices.</p></p>
