<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steroids</li><li>Nonsteroidal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor market is divided into two main types: steroidal and nonsteroidal inhibitors. Steroidal AR inhibitors, often derived from natural hormones, bind to androgen receptors, blocking their activity and influencing downstream effects related to conditions like prostate cancer. Nonsteroidal AR inhibitors, on the other hand, are synthetic compounds designed to selectively inhibit androgen receptor activity without the steroid structure. Both types aim to disrupt androgen signaling, providing therapeutic options for hormone-sensitive diseases.</p></p>
