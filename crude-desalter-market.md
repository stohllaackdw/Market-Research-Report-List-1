<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Desalter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Desalter</li><li>Two-stage Desalter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude desalter market comprises two primary types: single-stage and two-stage desalters. A single-stage desalter operates with one separation step to remove salt and impurities from crude oil, making it simpler and cost-efficient for smaller processing needs. In contrast, a two-stage desalter utilizes two separation processes, enhancing the removal of contaminants and providing superior quality oil. This system is ideal for facilities handling heavier, high-salinity crudes, ensuring better product quality and efficiency in processing operations.</p></p>
